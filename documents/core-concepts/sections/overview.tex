The \GlossaryHyperRef{framework-arrowhead}{Arrowhead framework} itself consists of two categories of \GlossaryHyperRef{artifact}{artifacts}, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:framework}.
The first category constitute a framework of assumptions, concepts, values and practices that frame the problem domain of \textit{dynamic device coordination in the context of automation}.
The second category it is a set of software specifications and \GlossaryHyperRef{implementation-software}{implementations} meant to address that problem domain.
In this section, we provide an overview of the primary \textit{concepts} of the Arrowhead framework.
While \textit{assumptions} and \textit{values} may be possible derive from this overview, no other framework artifacts are considered here or in the rest of this document.

\subsection{Stakeholders and Artifacts}

There are two kinds of members of the world of Arrowhead, (1) \GlossaryHyperRef{stakeholder}{stakeholders} and (2) \GlossaryHyperRef{artifact}{artifacts}, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:world}.
The former denotes a person or organization engaged in an Arrowhead enterprise, while the latter is any thing or object, tangible or intangible, that could be relevant to consider as part of such an enterprise.
Stakeholders \GlossaryHyperRef{owner}{own}, \GlossaryHyperRef{maintainer}{maintain}, \GlossaryHyperRef{developer}{develop}, \GlossaryHyperRef{operator}{operate}, and \GlossaryHyperRef{user}{use} artifacts, among many other possible activities.
It is their business needs and ambitions that govern what and how Arrowhead artifacts will be employed.

\subsection{Devices, Systems and Services}

The most essential types of Arrowhead artifacts are (1) \GlossaryHyperRef{device}{devices}, (2) \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{systems} and (3) \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{services}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:device-system-service}.
\textit{Devices} constitute the physical computerized machines that make up the industrial complexes, vehicles, tools, and other things that could be made operational via Arrowhead.
Each device hosts, or runs, one or more \textit{systems}, which are \GlossaryHyperRef{communication}{communicating} \GlossaryHyperRef{instance-software}{software instances} that make their devices work toward whatever goals are set for them.
Finally, a \textit{service} is a set of related \GlossaryHyperRef{operation-service}{operations} that a system can make its device perform for a person or another system.
Services can be concerned with manufacturing, repair, analysis, or any other physical or virtual activity.
The service is the primary means whereby systems coordinate to fulfill their assignments.

    Each of these is an artifact.

\subsection{Service Provision and Consumption}

Communication between systems is formulated in terms of the \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provision} and \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consumption} of services, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:service-consumption}.
When a system \textit{provides} a service, it makes it available to other systems through \GlossaryHyperRef{interface-service}{service interfaces}.
Other systems can \textit{consume} its services by sending \GlossaryHyperRef{message}{messages} to the interfaces of those services.
When a service interface receives a message, it \GlossaryHyperRef{routing-message}{routes} it to the specific operation it targets.
That operation must ensure that the message conforms to its \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol-operation}{protocol} and \GlossaryHyperRef{policy-operation}{policies} before concretely handling it.
Operation protocols establish what messages must contain and when they may be sent in relation to other messages, while policies establish what other conditions must be satisfied for the \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-operation}{operation invocation} to be permitted.
In other words, a message satisfying an operation protocol guarantees that the message is understood by its receiving operation, while a message satisfying certain policies guarantees that the activity it would trigger is occurring under desirable conditions.
A policy may require that certain \GlossaryHyperRef{service-quality-of}{quality-of-service} guarantees can be met, or that the sender is properly authorized, among many other possible examples.

\end{figure}

\subsection{System Composition}

When certain systems consume each other's services, they form a \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems}.
Such a system-of-systems is able to perform activities none of its constituent \GlossaryHyperRef{subsystem}{subsystems} could perform on its own.
Two are kinds of system-of-systems have particular significance in the context of the Arrowhead framework.
These are (1) the \GlossaryHyperRef{cloud-local}{local cloud}, and (2) the \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-local-clouds}{system-of-local-clouds}, both part of Figure \ref{fig:system-of-systems}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figures/system-of-systems}
  \caption{
    The two primary kinds of Arrowhead systems-of-systems: the local cloud and the system-of-local-clouds.
  }
  \label{fig:system-of-systems}
\end{figure}

A \textit{local cloud} is a pool of \GlossaryHyperRef{resource}{resources}, managed by \GlossaryHyperRef{system-supervisory}{supervisory systems}, where at least one pooled resource is \GlossaryHyperRef{resource-local}{local}.
A \textit{local resource} derives its value from its physical \GlossaryHyperRef{attribute}{attributes}.
Furthermore, all local clouds have at least one \GlossaryHyperRef{boundary-local}{\textit{local boundary}}, which is a physical attribute that distinguishes artifacts inside the cloud from those outside it.
A local cloud may also have \GlossaryHyperRef{resource-virtual}{virtual resources} and \GlossaryHyperRef{boundary-virtual}{virtual boundaries}.
Raw materials, drones, and other systems are a few examples of resources the systems of a local cloud could manage.
Boundaries may be formed by physical location, electronic certificate issuance, among many other possible examples.
Please refer to Section \ref{sec:concepts:local-cloud} for more details.

A \textit{system-of-local-clouds} emerges when systems belonging to different local clouds consume each other's services.
They become important to consider when local clouds, perhaps separated by security or organizational boundaries, need to rely on other local clouds to accomplish their tasks.
Please refer to Section \ref{sec:concepts:solc} for more details.
