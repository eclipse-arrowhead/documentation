TODO

The three major categories of formats in which Arrowhead documentation can be expressed.
The categories are (1) print, (2) interactive, and (3) semantic.

Print documentation is concretely rendered as documents that can be printed out on paper.
Interactive documentation is presented in the form of an interactive computer application, such as a website or a plugin in a development environment.
Finally, semantic documentation exists as machine-readable definitions that can be used as input to produce other forms of documentation or generate other artifacts of interest (such as parts of computer programs).

As this document is a \textit{Reference Architecture}, it does not specify how to realize any of these three formats.
So-called \textit{Concrete Architecture} (CA) documents would have to be specified for each format of interest.
As this document is produced in LaTeX, I will write such a CA-document for LaTeX/print documentation at some later point.
