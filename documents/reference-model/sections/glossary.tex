\GlossaryEntry{architecture}{Architecture}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{model-concrete}{concrete model} of a \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems} defined in terms of certain \GlossaryHyperRef{model-reference}{reference models}, \GlossaryHyperRef{architecture-reference}{reference architectures} and other concrete architectures.
See also Section \ref{sec:introduction:scope}.

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
	    defines architecture as the ``combination of elements of a model based on principles and rules for constructing, refining and using it''.
		We consider ``combinations of elements of a model'' to be a ``model of a system-of-systems'' and to be ``based on principles and rules for constructing, refining and using it'' as building upon reference models and architectures.
		Our definition should be interpreted as being compatible but more specific.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
		defines software architecture as ``the structure or structures of an information system consisting of entities and their externally visible properties, and the relationships among them''.
		That definition is equivalent to our definition of \GlossaryHyperRef{model}{model}, with the exception that the thing being modeled has to be an information system.
		As our definition is concerned with a model and a system-of-systems, which must be an information system, we regard out definition as compatible but more specific.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{architecture-reference}{Architecture, Reference}
A significantly useful \GlossaryHyperRef{model-abstract}{abstract model} of a \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems} defined in terms of certain \GlossaryHyperRef{model-reference}{reference models} and other reference architectures.

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
		defines reference architecture as a ``model for an architecture description (for I[ndustry ]4.0) which is generally used and recognized as being suitable (has reference character)''.
		We consider a ``model for an architecture description'' to be an ``abstract model of a system-of-systems''.
		Our definition should be interpreted as being compatible but more specific.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
	    defines reference architecture as ``an architectural design pattern that indicates how an abstract set of mechanisms and relationships realizes a predetermined set of requirements''.
	    While we let the part about requirements be implicit, our definition should be interpreted as being compatible but more specific.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{architecture-service-oriented}{Architecture, Service-Oriented (SOA)}
An \GlossaryHyperRef{architecture}{architecture} concerned with \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{service} \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provision} and \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consumption}.

	}

\GlossaryEntry{capability}{Capability}
A task, of any nature, that can be performed by a \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{service provider}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		The term must be interpreted as being very general.
		It includes the abilities of consuming and providing services, reading from sensors, triggering actuators, among many other possible examples.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
		defines a capability as ``a real-world effect that a service provider is able to provide to a service consumer''.
		Our definition should be interpreted as being equivalent.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{cloud}{Cloud}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems} able independently execute given tasks through the use of pools of owned resources.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		When the term ``cloud'' is used elsewhere, it often refers to clouds with only virtual resources, such as compute, storage and software-defined network utilities.
		Here, we refer to such clouds as \GlossaryHyperRef{cloud-virtual}{virtual clouds}.
		By making the unqualified word ``cloud'' less specific, it becomes more clear how our \GlossaryHyperRef{cloud-local}{local cloud} concept shares similarities with other types of clouds.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{cloud-local}{Cloud, Local}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{cloud}{cloud} bound to a physical location due to its acting on or producing physical \GlossaryHyperRef{artifact}{artifacts}.

	\GlossaryNote{IoTA:AF}{
		provides an introduction to the local cloud concept in its second chapter, as well as an architectural definition in its third chapter.
		The following is an excerpt from the introduction:
		\begin{quote}
		The local cloud concept takes the view that specific geographically local automation tasks should be encapsulated and protected.
		These tasks have strong requirements on real time, ease of engineering, operation and maintenance, and system security and safety.
		The local cloud idea is to let the local cloud include the devices and systems required to perform the desired automation tasks, thus providing a local ``room'' which can be protected from outside activities.
		In other words, the cloud will provide a boundary to the open internet, thus aiming to protect the internal of the local cloud from the open internet.
		\end{quote}
		The third chapter contains the following:
		\begin{quote}
		In the Arrowhead Framework context a local cloud is defined as a self-contained network with the three mandatory core systems deployed and at least one application system deployed [...]
		\end{quote}
		Both of these descriptions are practical, in the sense that they emphasize engineering aspects.
		However, as this document is a reference model, engineering aspects are out of scope.
		To be able to use the above descriptions, we look for indications of what a local cloud is, rather than what requirements such should fulfill.
		The terms ``geographically local'', ``room'' and ``boundary'' clearly highlight the physicality of the local cloud itself, while the depiction of ``devices'' performing ``automation tasks'' makes it apparent that some kind of physical activity is involved, such as manufacturing.
		Finally, the local cloud being ``encapsulated'', ``protected'' and ``self-contained'' indicates that it is understood to exhibit a degree of independence with respect to the tasks it is given, which we expect all kinds of clouds to exhibit.
		Our definition should be interpreted as a summation of these characteristics.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{component}{Component}
An \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entity} being part of a \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system}, contributing to it facilitating its \GlossaryHyperRef{capability}{capabilities}.
Compare with \GlossaryNameRef{subsystem}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		While ``component'' generally is a rather open-ended term, in the context of Arrowhead it gains the rather specific meaning of being a constituent of a system.
		If referring to a constituent of a \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems}, prefer use of the words ``system'' and ``subsystem''.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		A component is practically distinct from a system by being unable to \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provide} or \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consume} \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{services} independently.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
		makes no practical distinction between components and systems, as is done here.
		See \GlossaryNameRef{system} for more details.

		The presence of constraints enable \GlossaryHyperRef{validation}{validation}.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{

	}

\GlossaryEntry{consumer-service}{Consumer, Service}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system} currently \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-function}{invoking} a \GlossaryHyperRef{function}{function} \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provided} via a \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{service}.

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
		defines a service consumer as ``an entity which seeks to satisfy a particular need through the use [of] capabilities offered by means of a service''.
		We require that the one consuming the service is (1) a \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system} rather than just any \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entity}, as well as (2) that the \GlossaryHyperRef{capability}{capabilities} of the consumed service be exercised by invoking a function.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{data}{Data}
A sequence of \GlossaryHyperRef{datum}{datums} recording a set of \GlossaryHyperRef{description}{descriptions} via the structure superimposed by a \GlossaryHyperRef{type-data}{data type}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		Let us assume that some data is going to be sent to a drilling machine.
		The type associated with the data requires that it always consists of 8 bits, organized such that the first 4 bits indicate the speed of drilling in multiples of 100 rotations per minute, while the latter 4 determine how much to lower the drill in multiples of 5 millimeters.
		A \GlossaryHyperRef{state}{state} that could be expressed with those 8 bits is \texttt{0100 1101}.
		If each of the two sequences of 4 bits is treated as a big-endian integer with base 2, they record $4$ and $13$ in decimal notation.
		This would indicate that the drill should spin at $4 * 100 = 400$ rotations per minute and be lowered $13 * 5 = 65$ millimeters.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		Without knowledge of the types and context associated with some data, that data cannot be interpreted.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		An entity being uniquely identifiable does not necessarily mean that it is associated with a certificate or \GlossaryHyperRef{identifier}{identifier}.
		It only means that a \GlossaryHyperRef{description}{description} can be rendered that unambigously refers to the entity in question.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{

		For example, HTTP \cite{fielding2014hypertext} provides provisions for an extending protocol to define its own set of directory operations, to simultaneously support multiple \GlossaryHyperRef{codec}{codecs}, and so on.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 3}{
		As long as a given protocol provides at least one message whose contents can be arbitrary, a subprotocol can be produced.
		This means that even protocols not designed to be extended can, in some context, be meaningfully used to define subprotocols.

\GlossaryEntry{provider-service}{Provider, Service}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system} that makes \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{services} available for \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consumption} by any systems able to satisfy its \GlossaryHyperRef{policy-service-consumption}{consumption policies}.

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
		defines a service provider as ``an entity (person or organization) that offers the use of capabilities by means of a service''.
		Our definition is more specific in that it requires the \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entity} be a system.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{qos}{QoS}
See \GlossaryNameRef{service-quality-of}.

\GlossaryEntry{relationship}{Relationship}
A uni-directional association of two \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entities}, possibly with an associated \GlossaryHyperRef{data}{data} name.

\GlossaryEntry{routing-message}{Routing, Message}
The act of forwarding a \GlossaryHyperRef{message}{message} towards the \GlossaryHyperRef{function}{function} it is meant to \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-function}{invoke}.

\GlossaryEntry{service}{Service}
A set of \GlossaryHyperRef{function}{functions} that can be \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provided} via a \GlossaryHyperRef{interface-service}{service interface}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		As each function of a service represents its own \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol}{protocol}, the service itself becomes the union of all those protocols.
		This introduces the need to be able to determine how to forward \GlossaryHyperRef{message}{messages} received by the service to its functions.
		This is accomplished through \GlossaryHyperRef{routing-message}{message routing}.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
		defines a service as ``separate scope of functions offered by an entity or organization via interfaces''.
		Our definition implicitly restricts service provision to systems, as only \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{systems} can provide services.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{SOA-RM}{
		defines a service as ``the means by which the needs of a consumer are brought together with the capabilities of a provider''.
		Our definition is more specific about how the \GlossaryHyperRef{capability}{capabilities} of a service are made available.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{IoTA:AF}{
		defines a service as ``what [is] used to exchange information from a providing system to a consuming system''.
		It further adds that ``in a service, capabilities are grouped together if they share the same context''.
		The definition presented here should be interpreted as being compatible but more specific about how information is exchanged and capabilities are \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-function}{invoked}.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{service-quality-of}{Service, Quality of (QoS)}
The degree of performance at which a given \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{service} is \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provided}. 

\GlossaryEntry{shell-administrative}{Shell, Administrative}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{manifest-system}{manifest} and a \GlossaryHyperRef{interface-system-management}{management interface} associated with a certain \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		The availability of both a manifest and a management interface allows for both static and dynamic details about a system to be queried, as well as providing for the \GlossaryHyperRef{configuration}{configuration} of the system to be changed.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
		defines administration shell as a ``virtual digital and active representation of an I[ndustry ]4.0 component in the I[nustry ]4.0 system''.
		It also adds that ``an administration shell contains the manifest and the component manager'' and depicts the shell as wrapping, or being associated with, an \GlossaryHyperRef{asset}{asset}.
		Apart from our referring to \GlossaryHyperRef{component-industry40}{Industry 4.0 components} as \GlossaryHyperRef{system-industry40}{Industry 4.0 systems}, as well as the added qualification that the asset in question be a system, our definitions should be interpreted as being equivalent.
	}

\GlossaryEntry{signature-function}{Signature, Function}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{model}{model} specifying the \GlossaryHyperRef{type-data}{type} of the \GlossaryHyperRef{message}{message} a given \GlossaryHyperRef{function}{function} accepts when \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-function}{invoked}, as well as the types of any messages it could return in response.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		This means that a function signature establishes a \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol}{protocol} for a certain \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{service} function.

\GlossaryEntry{stack-extensible-protocol}{Stack, Extensible Protocol}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{stack-protocol}{protocol stack} whose topmost \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol}{protocol} is \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol-extensible}{extensible}.

\GlossaryEntry{stack-protocol}{Stack, Protocol}
A stack with an \GlossaryHyperRef{protocol-extensible}{extensible protocol} as base and $n > 0$ \GlossaryHyperRef{subprotocol}{subprotocols} layered on top of it.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		Every protocol part of a protocol stack, with the exception of the topmost, must be extensible.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		An example of a notable protocol stack is that of HTTP \cite{fielding2014hypertext}.
		It is defined as an extension of the TCP protocol, which in turn extends the IP protocol, which can work as a subprotocol of several other lower-level protocols.
		HTTP is an \GlossaryHyperRef{stack-extensible-protocol}{extensible protocol stack}, which allows for an engineer to define an application-specific protocol on top of its stack.

\GlossaryEntry{stakeholder}{Stakeholder}
A person or group of persons who are involved in or affected by certain \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entities} or enterprises.

\GlossaryEntry[(noun)]{state}{State}
One out of all possible sequences of values that could be expressed by the \GlossaryHyperRef{datum}{datums} of some \GlossaryHyperRef{data}{data}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		If the data would consist of a sequence bits, which can only have the values 0 and 1, a state becomes a pattern of zeroes and ones those bits can record.
		Given four bits, possible states could, for example, be \texttt{0010} or \texttt{1001}. 
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		The term is often used as a wildcard for any kind of storage construct, including bit flags, state machines and graph databases.

\GlossaryEntry{system}{System}
An \GlossaryHyperRef{entity}{entity} capable of \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{providing services}, \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consuming services}, or both.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		The word ``system'' is more generally understood to be very inclusive, expressing the larger idea of connected \GlossaryHyperRef{component}{components} facilitating one or more \GlossaryHyperRef{capability}{capabilities}.
		From the perspective of Arrowhead, however, capabilities can only be \GlossaryHyperRef{invocation-function}{invoked} through \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{services}, which means that a system unable to provide or consume services can only be described as a component of another system.
	}

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		A system is practically distinct from a \GlossaryHyperRef{system-of-systems}{system-of-systems} by being represented only by a single \GlossaryHyperRef{identity}{identity}.
		In contrast, a system-of-systems does either not have its own identity, or has both its own identity and another identity for each of its \GlossaryHyperRef{subsystem}{subsystems}.

\GlossaryEntry{system-industry40}{System, Industry 4.0}
A \GlossaryHyperRef{system}{system} with an associated \GlossaryHyperRef{shell-administrative}{administrative shell}.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 1}{
		A system being an Industry 4.0 system is not necessarily the same as it being Industry 4.0 \textit{compliant}.
		Industry 4.0 compliance is outside the scope of this reference model.

	\GlossaryNote{RAMI4.0}{
		introduces the concept of ``Industry 4.0 components'', which ``are globally and uniquely identifiable participants capable of communication, and consist of the administration shell and the asset [...] with a digital connection within an I[ndustry ]4.0 system [...], and offer services there with defined quality of service [...] properties''.
		Given that you have read our definitions for system and \GlossaryHyperRef{component}{component}, you will notice that our understanding of the system aligns more closely with the above quotation than our understanding of the component.
		For this reason, we adopt the RAMI4.0 concept with the modified name, Industry 4.0 \textit{system}.
		Our definition should be interpreted as being equivalent to that of the RAMI4.0 Industry 4.0 component.

\GlossaryEntry{system-of-clouds}{System-of-Clouds (SoC)}
A set of \GlossaryHyperRef{cloud}{clouds} that \GlossaryHyperRef{consumer-service}{consume} each other's \GlossaryHyperRef{service}{services} in order to facilitate a \GlossaryHyperRef{capability}{capability} none of the constituent local clouds could \GlossaryHyperRef{provider-service}{provide} on its own.

	\GlossaryNote{Note 2}{
		A data type provides only syntactic, or structural, information about data.
		While knowing the data type used to code some data is required for its interpretation, contextual knowledge is also needed.
