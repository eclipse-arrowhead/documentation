# Core Documentation for Eclipse Arrowhead

This repository is meant to be the authoritative source for core Arrowhead documentation not specifically tied to any particular software or hardware implementation.
To download the PDFs that can be produced from the files in this repository, please look at the assets of the [latest release](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/documentation/releases).

More instructions on how to build the documents located here will be added to here in the future.
